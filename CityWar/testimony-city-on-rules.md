## City War 1

**Honorable Judges,**

1. **The Proposed Rule Change Unfairly Targets Disabled Veterans**  
   The rule change in question solely impacts disabled veterans who wish to operate as mobile food vendors. However, no change is necessary, as disabled veterans holding Mobile Food Vending Unit permits are already permitted to vend on all streets except those explicitly listed in Subdivision 7 of NYS GBL 35-a. The current rules are sufficient, and further restrictions are unwarranted.

2. **City Council Lacks Authority to Alter State-Legislated Rights**  
   The City Charter does not grant the City Council the authority to revoke vending rights explicitly provided to disabled veterans by the NY State Legislature. According to the Preemption Doctrine, any local law that conflicts with state law is null, void, and unenforceable.

   Since its inception in 2011, **24 RCNY 6-13** has violated the Preemption Doctrine by imposing excessive restrictions on disabled veterans' vending rights. Any new legislation must first repeal this regulation, as it illegally abridges state-granted rights and imposes undue hardship on veterans. Such discriminatory regulation is unenforceable and must be struck down.

3. **Discriminatory Practices and Arbitrary Restrictions**  
   The current system disproportionately penalizes disabled veteran vendors. While there are 3,100 mobile food vendors authorized to operate in Midtown, only 105 slots are allocated to disabled veterans. This disparity is unjustifiable.

   Furthermore, NYS GBL 35-a itself is arbitrary and capricious, and the NYS Legislature has an obligation to repeal it. Disabled veteran vendors are the only group bound by these restrictive prohibitions, while an estimated 23,000 illegal vendors operate freely across the city with minimal enforcement. The presence of bicycle racks, restaurant dining sheds, bus stops, sidewalk furniture, and expanded pedestrian configurations demonstrates that there is no valid reason to restrict a small number of disabled veterans from vending.

4. **Failure to Address Existing Violations**  
   It is unconscionable for the City Council to consider new legislation while ignoring a fundamentally broken and discriminatory system. Disabled veterans, who have already sacrificed for their country, are being unjustly penalized and denied their rightful opportunities.

5. **Legal Violations**  
   Beyond contravening state statutes, the City has violated multiple federal protections, including:

   - **The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**
   - **The Rehabilitation Act of 1973**
   - **New York Executive Law Section 296**

   These violations further underscore the urgent need to prioritize the rights of disabled veterans.

**Conclusion**  
The current system fails to honor the service and sacrifice of disabled veterans. It is imperative that any legislative changes first address these inequities, repeal harmful regulations like 24 RCNY 6-13, and ensure compliance with state and federal law.

Put Veterans First.

Respectfully,  
**Armando Crescenzi**
