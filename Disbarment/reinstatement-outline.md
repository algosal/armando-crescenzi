To have Armando A. Crescenzi reinstated to the practice of law after disbarment, there are specific steps and requirements that he would need to fulfill. Reinstatement after disbarment is a rigorous process, as it is designed to ensure that the individual has sufficiently demonstrated rehabilitation and fitness to return to the legal profession.

Here is an outline of the steps involved in the reinstatement process:

### **1. Minimum Time Requirement**

The **New York State Rules** set a minimum period of time that must pass before a disbarred attorney can apply for reinstatement. Generally, for disbarment due to professional misconduct (such as in Crescenzi’s case), the waiting period is **seven years** from the effective date of the disbarment. Crescenzi was disbarred in **2008**, so he would be eligible to apply for reinstatement in **2015** (seven years after the disbarment).

### **2. File a Petition for Reinstatement**

To initiate the reinstatement process, Crescenzi would need to file a **petition for reinstatement** with the Appellate Division, First Department (or the department where the disbarment occurred). The petition must include:

- **Detailed Explanation of Rehabilitation**: Crescenzi must demonstrate that he has taken concrete steps to rehabilitate himself. This includes addressing the underlying issues that led to his disbarment, such as overcoming his drug addiction, maintaining sobriety, and engaging in therapy or counseling if appropriate.
- **Evidence of Good Moral Character**: The petition should include evidence that Crescenzi has returned to good moral standing in the community and that his actions since disbarment show a commitment to ethical behavior.
- **Proof of Compliance**: He must show that he has fully complied with the rules governing attorneys, including paying any owed restitution or fines.

### **3. Submit Evidence of Rehabilitation**

The petitioner must demonstrate substantial evidence of rehabilitation and fitness to practice law. This may include:

- **Drug Treatment or Rehabilitation Records**: Documentation of any drug rehabilitation programs or treatment Crescenzi has undergone since his disbarment. Evidence of continued sobriety, such as drug test results or letters from rehabilitation providers, would be important.
- **Letters of Support**: Letters from colleagues, family members, or community members who can vouch for Crescenzi’s character and his efforts at rehabilitation.
- **Personal Statement**: A statement from Crescenzi explaining the nature of his past misconduct, how he has changed, and why he believes he is fit to return to the practice of law.

### **4. Hearing Before the Disciplinary Committee**

Once the petition is filed, a hearing will likely be scheduled before the **Departmental Disciplinary Committee** or a **Special Hearing Panel**. During the hearing, Crescenzi will be required to present his case and provide evidence of his rehabilitation. The Committee will examine the evidence to determine if he has sufficiently shown that he is no longer a threat to the integrity of the legal profession and the public.

### **5. Factors Considered in Reinstatement**

When deciding whether to grant reinstatement, the Appellate Division will consider several factors, including:

- **Nature and Severity of the Misconduct**: The court will examine the original misconduct (misappropriation of client funds, criminal behavior, etc.) and how the individual has shown remorse and changed since then.
- **Length of Time Since Disbarment**: A longer period since the disbarment may suggest a higher likelihood of rehabilitation.
- **Character and Fitness**: The applicant’s current moral character, ethical behavior, and readiness to abide by professional standards will be carefully evaluated.
- **Efforts at Rehabilitation**: Whether the individual has made sustained efforts to address any underlying issues, such as addiction or dishonesty.

### **6. Decision on Reinstatement**

After the hearing, the Appellate Division will issue a decision regarding reinstatement. If the court finds that Crescenzi has sufficiently rehabilitated himself and is now fit to practice law, he may be reinstated with certain conditions. If the court determines that he has not demonstrated the necessary rehabilitation or moral fitness, the petition for reinstatement may be denied.

### **7. Additional Considerations**

- **Pro Bono Work**: While not required, engaging in pro bono legal work or community service may help show that Crescenzi has reformed and is committed to using his legal skills for the benefit of others.
- **Continuing Education**: Demonstrating that he has kept up with legal education during his disbarment (such as attending Continuing Legal Education (CLE) courses) can be beneficial in showing his commitment to the legal profession.

### **Conclusion**

Reinstatement after disbarment is a challenging process that requires clear evidence of rehabilitation, a change in character, and a commitment to ethical behavior. For Crescenzi, he would need to present substantial documentation showing he has addressed the issues that led to his disbarment—particularly his drug addiction and his professional misconduct—and that he has fully reformed his behavior. If he can meet these stringent requirements, he may be considered for reinstatement to the practice of law.
