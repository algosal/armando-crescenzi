   - Accept responsibility and demonstrate understanding of why these actions violated professional ethics.

3. **Timeline of Rehabilitation and Steps Taken**

   - Highlight the turning point (when he stopped criminal behavior and began recovery).
   - List treatments, counseling, or any support groups attended over the years.
   - Indicate how long he has remained sober and any significant milestones (e.g., 20 years of sobriety).

## 3. Start Drafting Section by Section

Once you have all your information and have created an outline:

1. **Begin with a Clear Introduction**

   - State the purpose of the petition (“Petition for Reinstatement”) and give a succinct background.
   - Mention that Mr. Crescenzi seeks to demonstrate rehabilitation and fitness to practice law.

2. **Describe the Past Misconduct Honestly and Succinctly**

   - Use neutral, fact-based language.
   - Show understanding of its seriousness and convey remorse.

3. **Present the Rehabilitation Timeline**

   - Organize it in chronological order: date of disbarment → start of therapy/recovery programs → key milestones (e.g., completion of treatment, length of sobriety, community service roles).

4. **Incorporate Supporting Documents or References**

   - Reference exhibits as you go (e.g., “Exhibit A: Letter from Commander of Post 19,” “Exhibit B: Completion Certificate from Rehab Program”).
   - Ensure they are well-labeled and clearly organized at the end of the affidavit/petition.

5. **Conclude with a Forward-Looking Statement**
   - Emphasize that Mr. Crescenzi is committed to abiding by ethical standards.
   - Highlight his strong motivation to use his law license to continue helping veterans and the broader community.

## 4. Get Feedback from Supporters

- **Ask for Letters of Recommendation:** From fellow attorneys, mentors, community leaders, or clients he has helped (in a non-legal capacity since disbarment).
- **Seek Guidance:** An experienced attorney who has handled reinstatement petitions can review your draft to ensure it meets procedural and evidentiary requirements.

## 5. Finalize and File

- **Proofread and Format Properly**
  - Each Appellate Division has its own format rules. Check for any page limits, notarization requirements, or additional forms.
- **File with the Correct Department**
  - The petition or affidavit must be filed in the same Appellate Division that disbarred him.
- **Expect a Review Process**
  - You may receive questions or a request for a hearing. Be prepared to provide further documentation or clarifications.
