**Disclaimer:** I’m not an attorney, and this response is for general informational purposes only. It’s always best to consult a qualified lawyer who is well-versed in New York’s rules governing attorney discipline and reinstatement.

Reinstatement to practice law in New York (whether you originally were admitted in New York City or elsewhere in the state) is overseen by the relevant Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York. While each department has slightly different procedures, the overall principles are similar. Below is a broad outline of how you might approach preparing a reinstatement petition for your friend, accompanied by general steps, suggested documents, and strategies to demonstrate rehabilitation and fitness to practice law again.

## 1. Understand the Governing Rules and Procedures

1. **Identify the Correct Appellate Division Department**

   - In New York State, attorney disciplinary matters and reinstatement petitions typically go through the Appellate Division Department in which the attorney was originally admitted or last practiced. For instance, if your friend was admitted via the First Department (covering Manhattan and the Bronx) or the Second Department (covering Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Long Island, etc.), the petition must follow their specific procedure.
   - Make sure you research the relevant court rules:
     - **22 NYCRR Part 603** (First Department), or
     - **22 NYCRR Part 691** (Second Department), etc.
   - Although people sometimes refer to “reinstatement to the NYC Bar,” technically attorneys are reinstated by the state’s judicial department where they were admitted.

2. **Review Disciplinary Records and Past Orders**
   - Determine the exact reason your friend was disbarred (the official charges and final order). This will clarify the requirements for reinstatement, the minimum waiting period (if any), and any conditions set by the disciplinary authority.

## 2. Gather Supporting Evidence of Rehabilitation

Because your friend’s disbarment involved serious misconduct—misappropriation of client funds, theft, and substance abuse—you need thorough documentation and evidence showing he has rehabilitated his character. Potential pieces of evidence include:

1. **Documentation of Sobriety and Rehabilitation**

   - Letters or certifications from reputable substance abuse counseling programs, Narcotics Anonymous (NA), or other 12-step programs (if he participated in those).
   - Drug/alcohol screening records (if available).
   - Personal statement detailing his journey to sobriety, his methods of staying sober, and his commitment to a drug-free lifestyle.
   - Evidence of regular therapy or counseling, if applicable.

2. **Criminal Record and Compliance with Probation (if any)**

   - If he was ever on probation for the theft, show documentation that he completed all court requirements successfully.
   - Show that there have been no criminal incidents in over seven years.

3. **Evidence of Community Service and Good Works**

   - Letters of recommendation from veterans’ organizations, especially from Post 19 in the Bronx, attesting to his efforts helping fellow veterans.
   - Documentation of volunteer work, charitable involvement, or pro bono assistance he may have offered—particularly any work benefiting indigent clients or veterans in legal matters, which demonstrates a positive use of his legal training despite being disbarred.
   - Character references from colleagues, mentors, religious or community leaders, local organizations, or other reputable individuals who can vouch for his honesty, responsibility, and moral character now.

4. **Medical Records (if relevant)**

   - Since he is a 100% disabled veteran, any medical or psychological evidence showing he has managed or overcome challenges that contributed to the past misconduct can be helpful.
   - Documentation clarifying that any disability does not impair his ability to competently practice law.

5. **Professional and Personal Achievements Post-Disbarment**
   - Proof of continued education or legal-related training (e.g., CLE courses or other advanced programs he might have taken to keep current with the law).
   - Details about leadership roles—like being Commander of Post 19 in the Bronx—and how these roles demonstrate responsibility and trustworthiness.

## 3. Draft a Compelling Petition / Affidavit for Reinstatement

Most appellate divisions require a petition or affidavit detailing why the individual should be reinstated. This often includes:

1. **Introduction and Background**

   - Outline his personal history:
     - Military service and honorable discharge (highlighting his service to the country).
     - Legal education (Pace University).
     - Admission date and place in New York.
     - Briefly mention the events that led to disbarment.

2. **Explanation of Misconduct**

   - Be honest and straightforward. Courts appreciate candor:
     - Acknowledge the wrongdoing (stealing from a restaurant, misappropriating client funds, past cocaine use).
     - Take responsibility for these actions without excuses but explain contributing factors (e.g., substance abuse, mental health struggles, PTSD if that played a part).
     - Convey remorse and understanding of why it violated professional ethics.

3. **Timeline of Rehabilitation and Steps Taken**

   - Show the timeline from the point of disbarment until now. Emphasize:
     - Treatment programs and support groups.
     - Clean drug tests or statements from sponsors/therapists.
     - The point at which he stopped criminal behavior and turned his life around.
     - Ongoing steps to ensure no relapse in conduct or addiction.

4. **Evidence of Good Character and Current Fitness to Practice**

   - Summarize all letters of recommendation or affidavits from personal and professional references.
   - Showcase awards or commendations (if he has been recognized for his work in veterans’ affairs, mention those).
   - Mention continued education or how he has stayed abreast of changes in the law.

5. **Commitment to Future Ethical Practice**
   - Articulate how he plans to adhere to the ethical rules going forward.
   - If he has set up a personal code of ethics or a support system (e.g., mentorship with another attorney), explain how it mitigates the risk of any future misconduct.
   - Emphasize the desire to serve underrepresented communities (like fellow veterans) and how reinstatement will allow him to use his legal skills for the public good.

## 4. Secure Strong Letters of Recommendation

1. **From Legal Professionals**

   - If any attorneys are willing to attest to his current good character, these letters are powerful in showing the legal community’s support.
   - Include specifics about how they’ve seen him change and how he interacts ethically and professionally now.

2. **From Community Leaders and Clients He Has Helped (Non-Legal Capacity)**

   - Veterans he has assisted, community organizers, or local leaders can provide insight into his positive impact, reliability, and trustworthiness.
   - Whenever possible, have them mention specific instances of his integrity and generosity.

3. **From Mentors, Therapists, or Sponsors**
   - If he has a sponsor from a 12-step program or a counselor who has overseen his progress for a significant period, such references carry weight.

---

## 5. Prepare for a Hearing (If Required)

Some Appellate Divisions or Character and Fitness Committees hold hearings for reinstatement petitions, where your friend may need to testify:

1. **Be Prepared to Speak About Past Misconduct**

   - He should be ready to discuss in detail what led to the misconduct, how it violated ethical rules, and what he has learned.
   - Show genuine remorse—explain what he’d do differently now.

2. **Demonstrate Current Moral Character**

   - Highlight steps he’s taken to ensure no repeat of unethical behavior.
   - Emphasize personal growth, community service, and ongoing sobriety.

3. **Anticipate Difficult Questions**
   - They may probe the events of the past, the financial and emotional aspects of his misconduct, and how he’s resolved any underlying issues (financial, psychological, or substance-related).

---

## 6. Submit the Petition and Supporting Documents

1. **Follow the Required Format and Filing Procedure**

   - Each department usually has specific formatting guidelines and a fee to file for reinstatement. Be sure to comply meticulously (page lengths, notarized affidavits, proof of service, etc.).
   - Missing or incomplete documents can delay the process.

2. **Maintain Organization**
   - Provide a clearly-labeled exhibit list for all letters of recommendation, certificates, and other supporting documents.
   - Make it easy for the reviewing committee or judge to see the timeline and evidence of rehabilitation.

---

## 7. Follow Up and Comply with Any Additional Requirements

1. **Monitor the Petition’s Progress**

   - The committee may ask for additional documents or clarifications.
   - Respond promptly and thoroughly.

2. **Complete Any Court-Ordered Evaluations**

   - In some cases, the court might require a psychiatric or substance abuse evaluation, additional CLE coursework, or other conditions before granting reinstatement.

3. **Stay Patient and Persistent**
   - Reinstatement can be a lengthy process. Even the strongest petitions might go through a thorough investigation phase. Persistence and transparency often pay off.

---

## 8. Consider Legal Assistance

While the process can be tackled by an individual, your friend might benefit greatly from hiring (or at least consulting) an experienced attorney or professional specializing in attorney discipline and reinstatement cases in New York. Such counsel can ensure that:

- All procedural requirements are met.
- The petition is crafted with maximum persuasive effect.
- Any potential issues are handled proactively rather than becoming stumbling blocks during the hearing.

### Final Thoughts

The key to reinstatement is demonstrating genuine rehabilitation, remorse, and a consistent track record of good conduct. Your friend’s many years of sobriety, community service, and leadership in the veterans’ community are strong points in his favor. Clearly documenting and presenting these elements—along with addressing past misconduct openly—should form the heart of the petition.

Again, this is **general information**. If possible, consult with a lawyer who has successfully guided others through the New York attorney reinstatement process. Their experience and familiarity with specific Appellate Division norms can significantly boost the chances of a positive outcome.
