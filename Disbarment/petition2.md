**Subject:** Petition for Reinstatement to the New York State Bar

Dear Honorable Justices of the Appellate Division,

I respectfully submit this petition for reinstatement to the practice of law in the State of New York. I fully acknowledge the gravity of my past misconduct that led to my disbarment on November 4, 2004, and I deeply regret the actions that resulted in my removal from the Bar. Over the past 20 years, I have taken significant steps to rehabilitate myself, uphold ethical and professional standards, and contribute meaningfully to my community.

Since my disbarment, I have dedicated myself to personal growth and service to others. Recognizing the need for accountability, I have actively participated in recovery programs addressing my past cocaine addiction. Through intensive rehabilitation and ongoing participation in support groups, I have remained committed to my recovery and personal development. The principles of honesty, integrity, and accountability that these programs instill have profoundly influenced my character, and I have embraced a lifestyle centered on ethical decision-making and responsible conduct.

In addition, I have devoted my time to assisting disabled veterans, working to support those who have sacrificed for our country. Through my efforts in legal research assistance, advocacy, and community outreach, I have sought to give back to a community in need while demonstrating my commitment to service and ethical responsibility. These experiences have reinforced my dedication to justice and fairness, values that are essential to the practice of law.

To ensure that I remain well-versed in legal principles and ethical obligations, I have engaged in continuing legal education (CLE) courses, with a particular focus on legal ethics and professional responsibility. Certificates of completion for these courses are annexed as Exhibit B. I am also prepared to take the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) as required to further demonstrate my understanding and adherence to professional standards.

I understand that reinstatement is not granted lightly, and I am prepared to undergo any further review necessary to establish my fitness to practice law once more. I welcome the opportunity to provide further evidence of my rehabilitation, including letters of recommendation from colleagues, community members, and support group sponsors who can attest to my character and commitment to ethical conduct.

I respectfully request that the Court consider my petition and grant me the opportunity to be reinstated as a member of the New York Bar. I am fully committed to upholding the highest ethical and professional standards in my future legal practice, and I would be honored to once again serve in the legal profession.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my petition further and provide any additional information that may assist in your deliberation.

**Respectfully submitted,**  
Armando Anthony Crescenzi
