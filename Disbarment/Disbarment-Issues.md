### **Report on the Disbarment and Suspension of Armando A. Crescenzi**

**I. Introduction**

Armando A. Crescenzi, an attorney admitted to practice law in New York in 1995, faced significant disciplinary action due to multiple instances of professional misconduct. This report synthesizes the facts surrounding his misconduct, disciplinary actions, and the eventual sanctions imposed, detailing both the suspension and disbarment proceedings.

**II. Case Overview**

Armando Crescenzi was involved in two major legal proceedings resulting from his professional misconduct, particularly the mishandling of client funds, dishonesty, and his drug addiction. His actions led to both an interim suspension and, ultimately, disbarment from the legal profession.

### **A. Disciplinary History and Early Charges**

In **February 2003**, Crescenzi was reported to the Departmental Disciplinary Committee by a former client, who complained about his failure to return funds from his escrow account (IOLA account). Further investigation revealed a series of ethical violations, including:

1. **Misuse of Escrow Funds:** Crescenzi admitted under oath that he had used client funds for his personal use, including to fund his drug addiction. This was a direct violation of professional ethics, which require lawyers to maintain client funds in trust accounts, free from personal use.
2. **Criminal Charges:** In addition to his professional misconduct, Crescenzi was arrested in February 2003 on charges related to theft from a restaurant owner. These charges included **petit larceny**, **criminal possession of stolen property**, **menacing**, and **harassment**. Although these charges were later adjourned in contemplation of dismissal in **December 2003**, Crescenzi’s criminal conduct further demonstrated his lack of professional integrity.
3. **Admission of Misconduct:** In **February 2004**, Crescenzi appeared for a deposition and, in sworn affidavits, admitted to using money from his IOLA account for personal use. Uncontested bank records verified that Crescenzi had written checks to cash, misappropriated funds, and failed to maintain proper escrow balances.

### **B. Interim Suspension (2004)**

Based on the substantial admissions of misconduct and the uncontested documentary evidence, the **Departmental Disciplinary Committee** moved for Crescenzi's immediate suspension from the practice of law under **22 NYCRR 603.4 (e)**. This section allows for suspension when an attorney's misconduct threatens the public interest.

The court determined that Crescenzi’s **misuse of client funds**, along with his **criminal conduct** and **failure to cooperate** with the disciplinary committee’s investigation, warranted immediate suspension. In **November 2004**, the Appellate Division, First Department, ordered that Crescenzi be suspended from the practice of law **until further order of the Court**.

### **C. Further Violations and the Path to Disbarment**

Despite the interim suspension, Crescenzi continued to face further allegations of professional misconduct. A subsequent investigation revealed the following aggravating factors:

1. **Dishonesty and Lack of Cooperation:** Crescenzi not only misappropriated client funds but also lied during the investigation. He failed to cooperate fully with the Committee’s investigation, refused to produce financial records, and submitted false statements regarding the missing funds.
2. **Crack Cocaine Addiction:** Crescenzi’s misconduct was further exacerbated by his drug addiction, specifically to crack cocaine. Although addiction can sometimes be a mitigating factor in disciplinary proceedings, the Committee found that Crescenzi's addiction did not fully explain or excuse his intentional misconduct. His drug use continued during the investigation, and he could only demonstrate that he had been drug-free for 50 days by the time of the hearing.
3. **Lack of Remorse or Rehabilitation:** The Committee noted that Crescenzi showed no indication of taking full responsibility for his actions or demonstrating the necessary steps toward rehabilitation. His continued drug abuse undermined any mitigating arguments based on his addiction.

### **D. Disbarment (2008)**

After a full hearing and a review of the findings, the **Hearing Panel** recommended disbarment. The recommendation was based on the **intentional conversion of client funds**, Crescenzi's **pattern of dishonesty**, his **failure to cooperate** with the Committee, and his lack of significant mitigation despite his personal struggles with addiction.

In **March 2008**, the Appellate Division, First Department, issued a ruling affirming the recommendation of disbarment. The Court found that Crescenzi's **intentional misconduct** and the **seriousness of his actions** warranted disbarment, particularly as no **extraordinary mitigating factors** were present.

Crescenzi's **disbarment was made retroactive** to February 1, 2006, the date when he stopped using drugs regularly. Despite his personal hardships, including his addiction, the Court concluded that he had failed to establish the necessary causal link between his addiction and his professional misconduct. His actions—specifically his decision to steal client funds—were done with clear intent and a level of rationality that did not justify a lesser sanction.

**III. Conclusion**

The **Matter of Armando A. Crescenzi** illustrates the serious consequences for attorneys who engage in unethical behavior, particularly the misuse of client funds and dishonesty. Despite mitigating factors like his drug addiction, Crescenzi’s intentional misconduct, lack of full cooperation, and failure to demonstrate genuine remorse led to his eventual disbarment. This case serves as a stark reminder of the ethical responsibilities of lawyers and the severe professional repercussions for violations of those duties.
